Looking to access the dark web? To get started, you'll need to download Tor Browser, a secure web browser based on Firefox that is designed to access the darknet. You can download Tor Browser for Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Android on the Tor Project website. If you're using an iOS device, you can use Onion Browser instead, which is specifically designed for the platform.

Another option is Brave Browser, which supports both Tor and Onion protocols and is available for desktop and mobile devices.

You can download tor browser from link here: https://www.torproject.org/download/

Is accessing the dark web legal? While using Tor is legal in most countries, certain activities, such as buying or selling drugs, weapons, counterfeit money, or abusive materials, may be illegal depending on your location.

What is the dark web? The Web is divided into three main areas: the surface web (or clearnet), the deep web, and the dark web. The surface web includes publicly accessible resources that can be indexed by search engines, while the deep web includes password-protected resources that are not indexed. The dark web, on the other hand, is only accessible through specific software and cannot be accessed through a standard web browser. This includes secure drops for whistleblowers and communication channels for activists, journalists, and human rights activists, but also illegal marketplaces and shops.

What is Tor? Tor (The Onion Router) is open-source software that helps to hide a user's location and protect them against surveillance or traffic analysis by bouncing their internet traffic through a network of almost a million relays worldwide. This makes it more difficult to trace a user's online activity, including website visits, online posts, and instant messages.

How does Tor work? When using Tor, your traffic passes through three intermediate nodes, each with a separate layer of encryption. This makes it so that nobody watching your connection can read what you're sending or where it's going. The first node, known as the guard node, knows your IP address but not your destination, while the exit node knows your destination but not your identity.

What are hidden services? Hidden services are only accessible within the Tor network and have domain names that end in .onion. These sites are not indexed by public search engines, and the only way to access them is to know their exact address.

How do you find hidden services? There are many Tor link lists, wikis, and catalogs available where you can find addresses for .onion sites. However, it's important to note that most link lists in the clearnet are not updated regularly and many of the links may not work. Before accessing any darknet site, it's crucial to ensure that it's legal in your country.

Who created Tor? The idea for onion routing was first created in 1995 by David Goldschlag, Mike Reed, and Paul Syverson at the U.S. Naval Research Lab as part of their research into creating Internet connections that were more secure. The project was later renamed Tor (The Onion Router) by Roger Dingledine and Paul Syverson, who worked on the project at MIT. Tor was officially deployed in 2002, and its source code was released under a free and open software license. Today, Tor is maintained by The Tor Project, a nonprofit organization founded by Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson, and others in 2006, with support from the US government, NGOs, private foundations, research institutions, private companies, and individual donors from around the world.
